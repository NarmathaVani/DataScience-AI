# DataScience-AI

# Building a classifier from to predict the Pass/Fail yield of a particular process entity
# and analyze whether all the features are required to build the model or not.

1.	DATA EXPLORATION:
  •	Class Imbalance Noted
  
2.	DATA PREPROCESSING
  •	Handling missing value
  •	Handling Encoding(label encoder, one-hot-encoder and dummy variable)
  •	Handling outlier
  •	Feature scaling (standarisation, normalisation, min_max)
  •	Handling imbalance dataset - only for classification problem
  
3.	FEATURE ENGINEERING:
  •	Using PCA reduced almost 400 Features
  
4.	DATA MODELLING:
  Splitting the data into Train and Validation
  RandomForest Algorith Used
  
5.	METRICS:
  Confusion matrix
